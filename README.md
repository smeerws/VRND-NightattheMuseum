# VRND-Night at the Museum (P5)

* Google VR SDK for Unity 5.5.1f1 (personal 64 bit): gvr-unity-sdk-1.0.3
* platform: Android 7.0, Sony Xperia X Compact


In the 5th Udacity Nanodegree project the task was to build a museum experience with the theme of VR application areas.
I chose the topic Robotics in combination with virtual reality, because I love and worked with robots. 
In my museum experience the visitor learns how robotics could support virtual reality and vice versa. 
All in all the exhibit covers application areas in professional training, robots as simulation tool to improved
presence, topics in research, telepresence robots and machine learning. 

After first ideas to combine robots with virtual reality, the museum building had to be made. I have decided that a building in the direction of a 
warehouse or a factory is ideal. At this time I visited some museums and exhibits ([Museum der Moderne](http://www.museumdermoderne.at/), Salzburg and the [MAK](http://www.mak.at/hello_robot) in Vienna.
Following the great experiences in these museums I tried to give every station a special characteristic. 
The visitor can sometimes only look at things, like at the sci-fi posterwall or the improved presence cylinders, or can actively choose things such as at the definitions station. 
Especially the entrance area is inspired by the visited museums. 
All in all in this project I combined images, videos, sounds, animations to form my museum experience. 


### Notes
I developed the experience with Unity 5.1.1, so only full screen movies were possible on Android. With Unity >= 5.6 also movies on gameobjects are possible. 
This I have learned during the development :). 

It was very much work to build this experience. It started with the initial research. 
I have now a lot more information. 
However, the process which information should come to the museum experience took its time.
Furthermore, the video and sound search and selection was very time consuming.

I did a very simple and direct user testing. 
The user tried the app and talked about the experience while using it (Method: Think aloud). 
After each test I improved the museum experience. 

!! In unity the videos (Drone flight and Professionl training) can't be triggered in the unity editor. However, if the app is running on the smartphone the videos are triggerable. !!
